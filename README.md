Generic Configuration Explorer Api

ASP Net 5 implementation of a WebApi that provides an explorer to view the application running configuration, provided the correct models

At startup, the configuration files are bound to the respective models, and for each one, a controller for consultation is dynamically created.

For ease of use and demonstration, swagger is enabled at host:port/swagger :)
